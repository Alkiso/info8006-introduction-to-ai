# Intelligence?

- What we covered so far...
    - Search algorithms, using a model specified by domain knowledge.
    - Adversarial search, for known fully observable games.
    - Constraint satisfaction problems, by exploiting a known structure of the states.
    - Logical inference, using well-specified facts and inference rules.
    - Reasoning about uncertain knowledge, as represented using domain-motivated graphs.
- Enough to implement complex and rational behaviors, *in some situations*.
- But is that **intelligence**?
- Aren't we missing a distinctive feature of intelligence?

# Chomsky vs. Piaget

.grid[
.col-2-3[
- *Noam Chomsky* (innatism):
    - State that humans possess a genetically determined faculty for thought and language.
    - The structures of language and thought are set in motion through interaction with the environment.
- *Jean Piaget* (constructivism):
    - Deny the existence of innate cognitive structure specific for thought and language.
    - Postulate instead all cognitive acquisitions, including language, to be the outcome of a gradual process of construction, i.e., a learning procedure.

<span class="Q">[Q]</span> What about AI? Should it be a pre-wired efficient machine? Or a machine that can learn and improve? or maybe a bit of both?

# Learning

- What if the environment is *unknown*?
- **Learning** can be use a system construction method.
    - i.e., expose the agent to reality rather trying to hardcode reality into the agent's program.
- Learning can be used as an *automated way* to modify the agent's decision mechanisms to improve performance.

# Learning element

- The design of the **learning element** is dictated by:
    - What type of performance element is used.
    - Which functional component is to be learned.
    - How that functional component is represented.
    - What kind of feedback is available.
- Examples:    

.center.width-70[![](figures/lec8/table-components.png)]
- The nature and frequency of the feedback often determines a learning strategy:
    - *Supervised learning*: correct answer for each instance.
    - *Reinforcement learning*: occasional rewards.
    - *Unsupervised learning*: no feedback!

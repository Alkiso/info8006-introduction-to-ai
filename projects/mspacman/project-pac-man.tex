\section{Pratical Information}
\begin{itemize}
	
    \item Deadline: December 22.
    \item You must work in groups of 2 students.
    \item Deliverable 1: A Python implementation of the classes \texttt{Agentsearch} and \texttt{Agentghost}, as defined in the  \texttt{agentsearch.py} and \texttt{agentghost.py} templates. See source code for more details
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item \danger If your agent's action violates the game constraints, it will be ignored,
        \item Free to use any library, as long as it does not hurt your code organization and clarity, and you are able to explain the principles behind it.
        \item The name of your agent classes should be \texttt{Agentsearch\emph{numstudent1}\emph{numstudent2}} and \texttt{Agentghost\emph{numstudent1}\emph{numstudent2}} where \emph{numstudent1} and \emph{numstudent2} are your student IDs without the "s". Name of your main agent class file should be respectively \texttt{agentsearch\emph{numstudent1}\emph{numstudent2}.py} and \texttt{agentghost\emph{numstudent1}\emph{numstudent2}.py}. 
        
    \end{itemize}
    \item Deliverable 2: A report of 7 pages max. in which should appear, for each stage of the project :
    	\begin{itemize}
        	\item The approaches you have considered to implement your agents.
            \item Their limitations for the current and the next stage of the project.
            \item Comparisons with some naive approaches.
            \item Briefly but clearly discuss about better strategies than your current work. "We could use X" is not enough, you need to explain the benefits (and drawbacks) of the claimed "better" approaches.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Upload your deliverables (\texttt{agent.py} and \texttt{report.pdf}) as a tar.gz archive on the \href{http://submit.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/student/viewprojects/INFO8006}{Montefiore submission platform}.

	\item You will be evaluated on the following criterions : 
    \begin{itemize}
		\item Score + computation time of your agents.
        \item Organization and clarity of your code.
        \item Quality of your report.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Pac-Man Game}

The games consists in eating all seeds while avoiding ghosts in a fully observable maze. Game ends when eitehr Pacman has eaten all the seeds (winning game) or has been hit by a ghost (game over). Figure \ref{fullmaze} shows an example of a Pacman maze with a single seed. 

\subsection{Step 1 : Search}

Pacman is let alone in a maze with an arbitrarily distribution of seeds over the map. The goal is to eat them all while minimizing a score based on the time spent to eat the seeds.\\

You are encouraged to try several algorithms as described in the \emph{Search} lecture. Remember there is an implicit time limit, as the game engine does not wait your computation to go on.

Complete the \texttt{Agentsearch} class template to address this step. More details can be found on the source code for completion.

\begin{figure}
	\label{fullmaze}
	\begin{center}
	
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{pacmazefull.png}
    \caption{Pac man and seeds in a maze}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}





\subsection{Step 2 : Search + Ghosts}

Ghosts (one or more) are added to the maze. Pacman has to avoid them while collecting all the seeds. If Pacman collides with a ghost, the game ends there with a negative score. The ghosts agents will behave using one of the following patterns, known by Pacman in game (except the last one) :

\begin{itemize}
	\item Pattern 1 : Counterclockwise left (see Figure \ref{counterclockwise} for more details) 
    \item Pattern 2 : Always move greedily towards Pacman
    \item Pattern 3 : Semi-random pattern defined below.
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Pattern 2 : 50\% 
        \item Pattern 1 : 25\%
        \item Random : 25\%
    \end{itemize}
    \item Pattern 4 (unknown by Pacman) : either pattern 1, 2 or 3.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
	\label{counterclockwise}
	\begin{center}
	
	\includegraphics[scale=1]{ghostclockwiseleft.png}
    \caption{Counterclockwise left. Ghost try first to go left and if it is not possible, analyze moves in a counterclockwise order until a legal move is found}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}



Big seeds are also added. When Pacman eats one of those, he has the ability to eat the ghosts also for a fixed amount of time. An eaten ghost repop anywhere in the map, also after a fixed amount of time. These parameters will be provided to the Agentghost class, which you'll have to complete to address this step. More details can be found on the source code for completion.\\

Like in the previous step, you are encouraged to compare several approaches, seen in this course or even from other sources. In the latter case, you'll have to explain carefully the principles behind the chosen approaches.

# Artificial narrow intelligence

- Artificial intelligence today is still very **narrow**.
    - Modern AI systems often reach super-human level performance.
    - ... but only at *very specific problems*!
    - They **do not generalize** to the real world nor to arbitrary tasks.

# AlphaGo

**Convenient** properties of AlphaGo:
- *Deterministic* (no noise in the game).
- *Fully observed* (each player has complete information)
- *Discrete action space* (finite number of actions possible)
- *Perfect simulator* (the effect of any action is known exactly)
- *Short episodes* (200 actions per game)
- *Clear and fast evaluation* (as stated by Go rules)
- *Huge dataset available* (games)

# Picking challenge

.center.width-100[![](figures/lec10/picking.png)]

- *Deterministic*: OK
- *Fully observed*: **OKish**
- *Discrete action space*: OK
- *Perfect simulator*: **TROUBLE**
- *Short episodes*: **challenge**
- *Clear and fast evaluation*: not good
- *Huge dataset available*: **challenge**

# Artificial general intelligence

- **Artificial general intelligence** (AGI) is the intelligence of a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can.
- No clear definition, but there is an agreement that AGI is required to do the following:
    - *reason*, use strategy, solve puzzle and make judgments under uncertainty;
    - *represent knowledge*, including commonsense knowledge;
    - *plan*;
    - *learn*;
    - *communicate* in natural language;
    - integrate all these skills towards *common goals*.

# Singularity

Irving John Good (1965):

- Let an **ultraintelligent** machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever.
- Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could *design even better machines*.
- There would then unquestionably be an **'intelligence explosion'**, and the intelligence of man would be left far behind.
- Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the *last invention* that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.

# How to build AGI?

Several working **hypothesis**:
- *Supervised learning*: "It works, just scale up!"
- *Unsupervised learning*: "It will work, if we only scale up!"
- *AIXI*: "Guys, I can write down optimal AI."
- *Brain simulation*: "This will work one day, right?"
- *Artificial life*: "Let just do what Nature did."

Or maybe something else?
